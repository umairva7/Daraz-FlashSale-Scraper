# Daraz-FlashSale-Scraper


This project is a web scraper built using Python and Selenium that extracts product information from the Daraz FlashSale page. The scraper navigates through the flash sale items, captures details such as product name, original price, sale price, store name, brand, and reviews count, and stores them in a CSV file.

## Features

- **Scrapes Multiple Products:** The scraper navigates through product pages and extracts relevant details.
- **Handles Missing Data:** The script accounts for missing product details (e.g., brand) without crashing.
- **Customizable Product Count:** You can adjust the number of products to scrape by setting the number of clicks for the "Load More" button.
